🧩 What Is Editor Master Tool?
Editor Master Tool is a modular editor extension for Unity that enhances and expands the capabilities of the Unity Editor with an intuitive UI and a suite of essential tools.

✨ Key Features
🧰 Modular Utility Panels

Hierarchy Organizer: Automatically group, sort, and rename objects in your hierarchy.

Scene Cleaner: Detect and remove missing components, unreferenced assets, empty objects, and unused prefabs.

Asset Processor: Bulk process assets (textures, materials, models) with custom rules and one-click operations.

Tag & Layer Editor: Edit project tags and layers in an intuitive GUI.

Prefab Toolbox: Batch override, unpack, or update prefabs in one operation.

Quick Actions Dock: Customizable shortcut buttons for common editor tasks (e.g., play mode toggles, snapshot scene, reset transforms, isolate selection).

Script Search Panel: Search for methods, classes, or variables inside scripts — instantly jump to them in the code editor.

🖱️ One-Click Automation Tools
Auto-Align & Distribute: Arrange selected GameObjects evenly in world or local space.

Mass Renamer: Rename thousands of GameObjects, files, or folders using smart rules, search/replace, and numbering schemes.

Serialized Data Viewer: Deeply inspect and edit serialized objects directly, even hidden fields or Unity-internal data.

🎛️ Visual Enhancements
Hierarchy Icons & Color Tags: Add visual cues to your hierarchy using icons, backgrounds, and color-coded labels.

Scene Gizmo Toolkit: Place and edit gizmos for easier scene visualization, including bounding boxes, wireframes, labels, and snap points.

Mini Map View: Get a bird’s-eye view of your scene — great for large levels or open worlds.

🧠 Smart Integration
Fully compatible with Unity's default inspector and all Unity versions from 2020.3 LTS and up.

Supports both URP, HDRP, and built-in render pipelines.

Seamless integration with existing tools and 3rd-party assets (e.g., Odin Inspector, Shader Graph, ProBuilder).

Custom editor window resizable and dockable just like any Unity panel.

🧑‍💻 Developer-Centric Features
🧪 Runtime Inspector Mode
Debug data in play mode, pause the game, and live-edit your objects and values — with Undo/Redo history and instant apply.

🧬 Serialized Reference Inspector
Inspect deep object trees, reference chains, weak references, ScriptableObject linkages, and shared dependencies across scenes and assets.

🔍 Advanced Search & Filters
Search by type, name, component, layer, tag, or even specific property values.

Filter GameObjects in a scene or project view based on criteria like missing references, active state, prefab status, or custom metadata.

🔧 How to Use It
Install the Tool: Import the EditorMasterTool package via the Unity Asset Store or Package Manager.

Access the Window: Go to Tools > Editor Master Tool from the Unity top menu.

Customize Your Layout: Drag the Editor Master window to any dock position or keep it floating.
